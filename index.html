            <section class="intro">
                <p class="paragraph 1">From crafting a promotional video for my dance crew at 12, my journey has expanded beyond the realms of digital design. While I began with Premiere Pro animations, my curiosity soon led me to the intricate worlds of <span class="bold">coding</span>, <span class="bold">software development</span> and <span class="bold">data science</span>. Whether it's creating dynamic web experiences with JavaScript and React, developing software solutions, or delving into data analytics, my passion for technology knows no bounds. </p>
                <p class="paragraph 2">My global experiences have further shaped my perspective. I spent eight transformative years in a boarding school in Nepal and later moved to UWC Maastricht, Netherlands for high school. Here, I collaborated with NGOs, college organizations, and local businesses. Now, I'm at Middlebury College in the picturesque Vermont, pursuing a degree in Computer Science, where I continue to blend design with functionality.</p>
                <p class="paragraph 3">Beyond the screen, my life is filled with melodies from my guitar, the excitement of soccer matches, and the adrenaline of a good workout. Each moment is a testament to my diverse passions. As my journey unfolds, I hope you'll share in the celebration of this blend of creativity, technology, and purpose.</p>
